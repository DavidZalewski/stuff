Literature Review

The intersection of quantum mechanics and gravitational wave physics has become a vibrant field of study, with various experiments aiming to unravel the complexities of quantum gravity. The double-slit experiment, first conducted by Thomas Young in 1801, showcased the wave-particle duality of light, serving as a foundational pillar in quantum mechanics. Recent advancements in quantum theory have expanded our understanding of this phenomenon, particularly regarding quantum superposition and entanglement (Nielsen & Chuang, 2010).

The detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015 marked a significant milestone, leading to new inquiries about the interplay between gravitational waves and quantum systems (Abbott et al., 2016). However, a gap remains in correlating gravitational waves with quantum phenomena. Studies have indicated potential connections between quantum fluctuations and gravitational waves, suggesting that gravitational effects may influence quantum systems (Maldacena & Susskind, 2013).

Several experiments have been proposed to investigate the quantum effects of gravity. One such proposal involves Entanglement Witness techniques, which aim to determine whether gravity can induce entanglement between massive particles. These experiments test the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics in the presence of gravitational fields, potentially revealing how gravity interacts with quantum systems (Rangamani & Tashiro, 2017).

Another notable study, "Testing the Quantumness of Gravity without Entanglement," explores how quantum effects can be observed in gravitational contexts without relying on entanglement. This research suggests that even classical gravity could exhibit quantum characteristics under specific conditions, providing insights into how gravity might operate at the quantum level (Oppenheim et al., 2021).

The moving double-slit experiment is a novel extension of the classic setup that offers insights into how particles behave in dynamic environments. Previous research has shown that the motion of slits can alter interference patterns, indicating that the wave function of particles can be affected by external conditions (Scully et al., 1999). Integrating this with gravitational wave detection could enhance our understanding of quantum interactions under extreme conditions.

Moreover, both analog and digital data capture methods are employed in quantum experiments and gravitational wave detection. The reliability of these data is critical for validating experimental results. Research on the limitations of digital versus analog data collection indicates that while digital systems offer precision and ease of analysis, analog systems are often considered more robust in certain experimental setups due to their longstanding application in physics (Klyshko, 1988).

By synthesizing insights from these diverse domains, this study aims to explore how gravitational waves interact with quantum particles, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity.
