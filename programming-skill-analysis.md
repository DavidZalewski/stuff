If you‚Äôd like help styling this into a branded PDF (with logo placement, typography, or professional layout hints), I can also help draft that side-by-side. Or, if you want to convert this into a formal performance management rubric‚Äîsay the kind used in engineering calibration‚ÄîI can do that too. Just say the word.
