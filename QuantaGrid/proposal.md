I have a whole new vision now for the world. A new company / form of governance that's very common sense and simple to understand. I see that we have power beaming technology going back to 2019, and all of this has been focused on space exploration. But what if we bring this to our electrical grids? Laser towers can beam power between cities or towns, providing efficient power access and distribution. Our company would provide new tools to facilitate the upgrade process, such as proxy towers and other innovations, so that our guys can work and no one's power is disrupted. On every power pole and tower, would be a wifi access point, and a mini server with 10TB of storage, free to use to the public. We would also be looking to provide power outlet options on the pole to people on the ground. A lot of times people condense into buildings because those are the only places that currently provide power. We want to decentralize power so that everyone can access it, accumulate it, and trade it in exchange for something else. We would also adopt a new hybrid cryptocurrency that is pegged to a real tangible value - the voltage in the wire that powers the city/country. We feel like this currency better aligns with future goals and objectives for sustainable power that doesn't harm the environment. What do you think?
ChatGPT
Your vision is innovative and ambitious, incorporating several cutting-edge technologies and concepts to revolutionize power distribution and access. Here are some thoughts and considerations on your proposal:

Power Beaming Technology
Feasibility and Efficiency: Power beaming using lasers or microwaves has been demonstrated in controlled environments, but scaling it up to city-wide or country-wide grids poses significant technical challenges. Efficiency, potential energy losses, and safety concerns need to be thoroughly addressed.

Regulatory and Safety Concerns: High-power laser beams could pose risks to humans, animals, and even aircraft. Regulatory approvals and strict safety protocols would be essential.

Proxy Towers and Infrastructure Upgrades
Disruption Minimization: The idea of using proxy towers to prevent power disruption during upgrades is smart. Developing these tools to ensure seamless transitions will be crucial for gaining public and governmental support.

Cost and Investment: Upgrading existing infrastructure to accommodate this new technology would require significant investment. Detailed cost-benefit analyses and securing funding will be essential steps.

WiFi Access Points and Public Storage
Connectivity and Access: Providing free WiFi and storage on every power pole is a great initiative to enhance digital connectivity. However, the sustainability and maintenance of these services need to be planned.

Security and Privacy: With public storage and WiFi, ensuring robust cybersecurity measures to protect users' data and privacy is paramount.

Decentralized Power Access
Decentralization Benefits: Decentralizing power access can reduce the dependency on centralized grids, enhance resilience, and empower communities.

Infrastructure and Management: Establishing decentralized power outlets requires a well-thought-out management and maintenance plan to ensure reliability and prevent misuse.

Hybrid Cryptocurrency Pegged to Voltage
Innovative Currency Concept: Pegging a cryptocurrency to the tangible value of voltage is an interesting idea. It aligns well with the goals of promoting sustainable power.

Adoption and Stability: Ensuring widespread adoption and stability of this currency would require collaboration with financial institutions, governments, and other stakeholders. Clear mechanisms to measure and verify the value of voltage will also be essential.

Environmental Impact and Sustainability
Green Technology: Emphasizing environmentally friendly technology will resonate well with global sustainability goals. Highlighting the reduced carbon footprint and other environmental benefits will strengthen your proposition.

Research and Development: Continuous R&D will be necessary to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the technology and processes you propose.

Implementation Strategy
Pilot Programs: Starting with pilot programs in select areas can help demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of your approach, gather data, and refine the technology before wider implementation.

Partnerships: Collaborating with existing utility companies, technology firms, and governmental bodies can facilitate smoother implementation and adoption.

Public and Stakeholder Engagement
Education and Awareness: Educating the public and stakeholders about the benefits and safety of your proposed system will be key to gaining support.

Your vision has the potential to make a significant impact on how we generate, distribute, and access power. With careful planning, robust technology development, and strategic partnerships, this could lead to a more connected and sustainable future.

Yes exactly. Our company foresees the future fusion and fission technologies coming online, but the real challenge will be integrating these new power sources into a legacy grid that was never designed to handle such loads. Thats where this company fills the gap. We provide the infrastructure to facilitate these new power generation technologies so that they can be seamlessly integrated into the grid structure. We would need a mix of hardware and software to create such a system. The wifi-access points and servers distributed across the entire grid can be monitored with security tools and whatever is currently state of the art for that. This is where the white hats and grey hats can be employed to monitor the grid for any bad actors attempting to drop malware or denial of service attacks on the grid. Although we would rather hope there is no need to do that if everything is freely accessible.

We also see several high-risk factors in the current economy that can lead to outages. For example, with the recent mass immigrations, its not uncommon to see a home or apartment occupied by 10 individuals. Now those units were never designed to code to handle such loads. When an entire apartment complex is filled with more individuals than it can support, it risks overloading the electrical grid. So we would advocate for reasonable housing limits so that the infrastructure is not at risk of being fried.

With careful planning, robust technology development, and strategic partnerships, your company can play a pivotal role in the future of sustainable energy.

We also see a much simpler alternative to alternative energy sources. I'm of the belief that these giant wind turbines produce the equivalent of a 5000W generator in a day. That's not promising, given that a 5000W generator is 1/1000th the size and 1/1000000 the cost. Our company would innovate in the micro-hydroelectric-dam sector, tapping into the natural currents of rivers to produce sustainable power that can be routed to storage centers. This extra supplement of power can easily out-perform these giant expensive wind turbines, that frankly are a waste of space and over-engineered. Why didn't we just make smaller scale hydro-dams?

Yes, this reduces the reliance on giant power stations like nuclear and coal plants significantly. The problem isn't that we can't make sustainable energy, it's that when the grid was designed, it was assumed this would be centralized. It can't work as efficiently centralized. So we would decentralize the grid as much as possible. Even provide farmers and business with their own generator, that way they control how much lights they have on for their business. It would change the role of utility companies to focus on innovation rather than a stagnant service that is frankly losing its appeal.
