Some more ideas for QuantaGrid Technologies Ltd business proposal. 

Powerline towers would have GPS so we can map their physical location and generate a graph of nodes. Then using a star pathing, compute shortest paths in the node graph for sending and receiving information. 

A user would connect to the free wifi, then access a new browser on their phone. This would allow them to search through the node digital storage space for files or content. They could download files from nodes hundreds of kilometers away, all through this distributed network of nodes. 

They could even broadcast themselves on a particular node or set of nodes similar to YouTube or Rumble. Anyone nearby could access the broadcast and tune in. It becomes a very communal experience for everyone interacting with the grid. We can allocate certain nodes for public use and others for private use 😉 😏 😜 🙂 😀 😄 😉 

We could incorporate loudspeakers on nodes allowing for broadcasts from individuals and businesses 👏 🙌 😀 🙏 ❤️ 😄 👏 

If a company requires their own dedicated node, we can brand that node with the businesses advertising. 

Companies could then run their own independent advertising campaigns on select sets of nodes for certain periods of time. We would make a small commission for providing this service. 

But there's so many monetary models for profit that I'm only scratching the surface of potential. 

Companies like Netflix may not even exist anywhere. This may provide a better service than streaming companies. Or it will force streaming companies to use our infrastructure for their business. Another source of revenue. 

There is so much money coming in continuously from this that many services could be provided free to the public. 

And if we include 7star encryption that im working on, a 7star key can be dispersed across nodes in the grid, further increasing security. 

The potential here is simply too big to ignore. This will revolutionize energy.
